Predictive Maintenance - Remaining Useful Life (RUL) Model
This repository contains a project focused on estimating the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of industrial machinery components, a crucial aspect of predictive maintenance that enables proactive maintenance scheduling and reduces unexpected machine downtime.

**Key Features:**
**Data Preparation:**
Timestamp and Sorting: Data is preprocessed by sorting based on device ID and date.
RUL Calculation: Using the date of each record to calculate the Remaining Useful Life for each device.

**Feature Engineering:** Additional features such as day of the week, month, and rolling averages for various metrics to capture temporal trends.

**Machine Learning Model:**
Data Splitting: The dataset is split into training and testing sets to validate model performance.
Scaling: StandardScaler is applied to normalize the feature space, improving model efficiency.

**Model Selection:** Techniques such as regression models and possibly more advanced algorithms (e.g., Gradient Boosting or LSTM for time series) can be integrated to predict RUL effectively.

**Performance Evaluation:**
Evaluation metrics will include Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-Squared, providing a comprehensive understanding of the modelâ€™s prediction accuracy.

**Technologies Used:**
Python: For data processing and model building.
Pandas: Data manipulation and feature engineering.
Scikit-learn: Model building, scaling, and evaluation.

**Project Objectives:**
Predict the remaining lifespan of machinery parts based on operational and environmental data.
Enable data-driven decision-making to optimize maintenance schedules.
Reduce unplanned downtime and extend the lifetime of equipment.
This repository is ideal for those interested in predictive maintenance applications and exploring RUL estimation techniques in machine learning.
